## About

Small React Native app built to enable someone to quickly get a look at the current price of Gas for transactions on Ethereum. There are plenty more features to add to the app: dark mode, multiple fiat currencies, as well as more than just the "average" cost of Gas. Join the [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/GSPyx2gW) to get the latest on the app before it's released onto the App Store to the public!
